﻿Write a console program, 
which inputs just a name (FullName or FirstName or LastName)
and then program makes a call to https://jsonplaceholder.typicode.com/users
and displays Address Information.

Example: would be:
--
-> Please enter the name
 Schulist
-> AddressInfo: "street": "Norberto Crossing", "suite": "Apt. 950", "city": "South Christy", "zipcode": "23505-1337"
      
--

There will be several problems here:
You can make a call with HttpClient class.
You can map received info into C# object with JsonConvert library.
